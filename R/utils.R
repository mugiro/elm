#' Distance matrix - vector
#'
#' The function \code{dist_mat_vec} compute the distance between each sample of
#' matrix (row-wise) and a reference vector.
#'
#' @param X A matrix with \emph{N} samples from a \emph{d}-space.
#' @param ref The reference vector, a sample/point from a \emph{d}-space.
#' @param type The particular method to compute the distance:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \emph{euclidean}
#' \item \emph{manhattan}
#' }
#' @return A vector of length \emph{N} with all distances
